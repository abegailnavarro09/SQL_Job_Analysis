The goal is to identify key skills that make data analysts more competitive in the job market, explore which specific skills lead to higher-paying roles, and determine the most in-demand data analyst roles. By leveraging SQL queries to analyze job listings, salary data, and skill requirements, the project aims to provide insights into the optimal skills for data analysts to enhance their career prospects.

### Questions to be answered using SQL Queries:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying data analyst jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (high demand and high paying skills)?

# Tools Used
For this project, I utilized a variety of powerful tools to analyze and manage the data efficiently:

1. **SQL**  - was used to query, filter, and analyze large datasets. It helped in retrieving specific information about job listings, salary data, and skill requirements.

2. **PostgreSQL** - was used to store and manage the data. It provided the necessary environment to handle complex queries and ensure data integrity.

3. **VSCode** - served as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and executing SQL queries. 

4. **Git** - was used for version control, allowing me to track changes, manage the codebase, and collaborate effectively during the development of the project.

5. **GitHub** - hosted the project repository, providing a platform for code sharing, collaboration, and version management. It also facilitated easy access to the projectâ€™s progress and codebase for future updates or collaboration.

# Analysis
The queries in this project focus on specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's my approach to addressing the key areas:

### Top Paying Data Analyst Job
```sql
SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        B.name as company_name
FROM
        job_postings_fact AS A
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS B ON A.company_id = B.company_id
WHERE
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

The query joins two tables to retrieve job postings for "Data Analyst" roles located "Anywhere" with non-null salary data. It filters the results based on specific conditions (location, non-null salary and Data Analyst jobs), sorts them by salary in descending order, and limits the output to the top 10 highest-paying jobs.

### Top Paying Data Analyst Job Skills
```sql
WITH top_job_table AS (
    SELECT
            A.job_id,
            A.job_title,
            A.job_location,
            A.salary_year_avg,
            B.name AS company_name
    FROM
            job_postings_fact AS A
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS B ON A.company_id = B.company_id
    WHERE
            A.job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
            A.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
            A.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    ORDER BY
            A.salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
        top_job_table.*,
        skills as top_skills
FROM
        top_job_table
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_job_table.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
```
The query first creates a temporary table with the top 10 highest-paying "Data Analyst" job postings based on specific conditions. Then, it joins this table with skill-related data to retrieve the corresponding top skills for each job, sorting the results by salary in descending order.

### Top Demanded Data Analyst Skills
```sql
SELECT
        skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS skill_demand
FROM
        job_postings_fact 
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
        skills
ORDER BY
        skill_demand DESC
LIMIT 5
```
The query first creates a temporary table with the top 10 highest-paying "Data Analyst" job postings based on specific conditions. Then, it joins this table with skill-related data to retrieve the corresponding top skills for each job, sorting the results by salary in descending order.

### Top Paying Data Analyst Skills
```sql
SELECT
        skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) as average_salary
FROM    job_postings_fact AS A
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS B ON A.job_id = B.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS C ON B.skill_id = C.skill_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
        skills
ORDER BY
        average_salary DESC
LIMIT 10
SELECT
        skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) as average_salary
FROM    job_postings_fact AS A
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS B ON A.job_id = B.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS C ON B.skill_id = C.skill_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
        skills
ORDER BY
        average_salary DESC
LIMIT 10
```
The query calculates the average salary for each skill associated with "Data Analyst" roles, filtering for jobs with non-null salary data. It groups the results by skill, orders them by average salary in descending order, and limits the output to the top 10 highest-paying skills.

### Optimal Data Analyst Skills
```sql
WITH top_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demanded_skills
    FROM job_postings_fact 
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
            job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
            job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
            salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
            skills_dim.skill_id
), top_salary AS (
    SELECT
        C.skill_id,
        C.skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) as average_salary
    FROM    job_postings_fact AS A
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS B ON A.job_id = B.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim AS C ON B.skill_id = C.skill_id
    WHERE
            job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
            job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
            salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
            C.skill_id
)

SELECT
        top_demand.skill_id,
        top_demand.skills,
        demanded_skills,
        average_salary
FROM    top_demand
INNER JOIN top_salary ON top_demand.skill_id = top_salary.skill_id
WHERE
        demanded_skills > 10
ORDER BY
        average_salary DESC,
        demanded_skills DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
The query first creates two temporary tables: one for the most demanded skills based on job postings and another for the average salary associated with each skill. It then joins these tables to get the skills that are both highly demanded and highly paid. The results are filtered to include skills with more than 10 job postings and are sorted by average salary and demand in descending order, limiting the output to the top 20 skills.

#### Shorter way to do this:
```sql
SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demanded_skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) as average_salary
FROM    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
        average_salary DESC,
        demanded_skills DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
The query calculates the demand and average salary for each skill associated with "Data Analyst" roles, filtering for jobs with non-null salary data and located "Anywhere." It groups the results by skill, only including skills with more than 10 job postings, and orders them by average salary and demand in descending order, limiting the output to the top 20 skills.

# What I Learned
By working with SQL on these problems, I learned how to:

- Identify top-paying jobs: I filtered and sorted job listings by salary to pinpoint the highest-paying data analyst roles. SQL helped me rank jobs based on compensation data for better insights.

- Analyze required skills: I queried job listings to extract the specific skills required for top-paying data analyst jobs. This allowed me to pinpoint the skills most valued by employers.

- Determine in-demand skills: I tracked the frequency of skill mentions in job postings using SQL. This helped me identify the most in-demand skills in the data analyst field.

- Analyze skills and salary: I used SQL to correlate specific skills with higher salaries by aggregating and grouping data. This helped me identify which skills are associated with higher-paying roles.

- Find optimal skills: I combined salary and demand data in SQL to identify the best skills to learn. By analyzing both high demand and high pay, I found the most valuable skills for data analysts.

# Conclusions
Working on this project using SQL provided valuable insights into the data analyst job market and the essential skills needed for top-paying roles. It sharpened my ability to query and manipulate data, allowing me to identify trends and correlations between salary, demand, and skills. Overall, this project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of how data-driven decisions can guide career development and skill acquisition in the data analysis field.
